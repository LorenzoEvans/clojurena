# Work In Progress!

## Usage


In order to use this library to interact with your personal are.na account, you will need to authorize Clojurena to access your account, which can be done with the string below:

https://dev.are.na/oauth/authorize?client_id=aa7365a1f8df2aec7b31405a7fa50944df77b2bd63c5bac07f97829168867da5&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&response_type=code

In order to obtain an access token, you will need to login to dev.are.na, with your are.na account information, and create a new application, fill out the required information, save it, and then, under "Your Applications", find the application you just created, and you will find some keys listed.
