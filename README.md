## Usage

In order to use this library to interact with your personal are.na account, you will need to authorize Clojurena to access your account, which can be done with the string below:

https://dev.are.na/oauth/authorize?client_id=aa7365a1f8df2aec7b31405a7fa50944df77b2bd63c5bac07f97829168867da5&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&response_type=code

In order to obtain an access token, you will need to login to dev.are.na, with your are.na account information, and create a new application, fill out the required information, save it, and then, under "Your Applications", select the application you just created, and you will find some keys listed, your Application Id, Secret, personal Access code, etc, these can be used in environment variables to access are.na on your behalf, or to allow your code to interact with other individuals are.na account on their behalf.
